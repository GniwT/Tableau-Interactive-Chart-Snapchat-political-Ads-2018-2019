Political advertising is a marketing campaigning that allows candidates to directly convey their message to voters and influence the political debate.  

In the past, the major platforms of political ads were newspapers, direct mail, radio, and television. In 2008, Barack Obama became one of the first candidates to use social media advertising in his campaign. Since then, the public became aware of just how powerful and game changing political advertising on social media could be.

This Tableau interactive chart pinpoints how Snapchat launched its politcal campaign based on the users' demogrphics during 2018-2019.
